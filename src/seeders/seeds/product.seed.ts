The multi-touch, Retina-quality display changes automatically based on what you're doing, from showing traditional system controls, such as volume and brightness, to more directly interacting with or browsing through content. Intelligent typing features like emoji and predictive text improve the typing experience, and you'll be able to customize the Touch Bar to fit your needs. The Touch Bar can also adapt to apps, such as Mail, Safari, Messages, and even third-party apps like Adobe Photoshop, so you'll have access to useful functions previously hidden in menus.\n\\nTouch ID\n\\nA Touch ID sensor has been integrated into the power button, so you can quickly log into your account, even when another user is logged in.

With up to a 16-Core GPU, the M1 Pro delivers up to 70 percent faster CPU performance than the M1.\n\\n\n\\n14.2\" Liquid Retina XDR Display\n\\nFeaturing mini-LED technology, this MacBook Pro houses a 14.2\" Liquid Retina XDR display. Delivering up to 1,000 nits of sustained, full-screen brightness, a high 1,600 nits of peak brightness, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, and a billion colors, the Liquid Retina XDR display can handle the extreme dynamic range of HDR content, providing detailed shadows, brilliant specular highlights, deeper blacks, and vivid colors. The display is less than 4 mm thin, which is achieved by having seven films and diffusers that mix and shape the light efficiently. The oxide thin film transistor (TFT) allows pixels to charge twice as fast as before.\n\\n\n\\nProMotion - Up to 120 Hz Refresh Rate\n\\nWith ProMotion technology, the MacBook Pro automatically varies the refresh rate to match the motion of your onscreen content. This helps preserve battery life while also making tasks feel more fluid and responsive. This means that the display can have up to a 120 Hz refresh rate. Video editors will also have the option to lock in a refresh rate that is optimal for their footage.\n\\n\n\\nP3 Wide Color Gamut\n\\nThe narrow-band LED-powered backlight allows the MacBook Pro to represent the P3 wide color gamut for brilliant, true-to-life color in photos and videos.\n\\n\n\\nStorage - Bring Your Whole Studio with You\n\\nThe MacBook Pro can be configured with up to 8TB of SSD storage so you can take your photo or video libraries with you no matter where you're headed. And with superfast speeds, massive files load in an instant and pro apps launch in a blink. This particular model comes with a 512GB SSD.\n\\n\n\\nConnectivity\n\\nThunderbolt 4\n\\nThunderbolt 4 combines ultra-high bandwidth with the versatility of the USB Type-C industry standard to create one revved-up universal port. It integrates data transfer, charging, and video output in a single connector, delivering up to 40 Gb/s of throughput for twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2. The MacBook Pro is equipped with three ports, so you can do all of that from either side. Existing devices are easily connected with a cable or adapter. And Thunderbolt 4 is reversible, so no matter how you plug in, it's always right side up.\n\\n\n\\nMagSafe 3\n\\nMagSafe 3 makes connecting a power cable quick and easy while also protecting your MacBook Pro. Apple also brings fast charging to the MacBook Pro, allowing you to charge up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.\n\\n\n\\nHigh-Fidelity Audio\n\\nSpatial Sound Speakers and Better Mics\n\\nThe MacBook Pro features a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system, which has two tweeters for a clearer soundstage as well as four force-cancelling woofers, resulting in 80 percent more bass. The sound system also supports spatial audio, providing a three-dimensional audio experience, whether you're listening to music or watching a movie in Dolby Atmos. Apple also has studio microphones that have a lower noise floor, resulting in clear calls as well as voice recordings.\n\\n\n\\nFaceTime\n\\nFull HD 1080p FaceTime HD Camera\n\\nNow with a Full HD 1080p FaceTime HD camera, the MacBook Pro uses the ISP and Neural Engine in M1 Pro and M1 Max for computational video that enhances video quality.\n\\n\n\\nSystem Navigation\n\\nKeyboard\n\\nPhysical function keys are back with the Magic Keyboard on the MacBook Pro. Replacing the Touch Bar, the familiar, tactile function keys have made their return. There is even a wider ESC key.\n\\n\n\\nTouch ID\n\\nThe Touch ID enables fast, easy authentication for secure logins and purchases.\n\\n\n\\nForce Touch Trackpad\n\\nSpeed your workflow with Force click and multi-touch gestures.\n\\n\n\\nAll-Day Battery Life\n\\nBattery\n\\nFrom pro workflows to everyday tasks, the MacBook Pro delivers power efficiency while still maintaining performance. The MacBook Pro can deliver up to 17 hours of video playback.",

With an immersive 16-inch Retina display, superfast processors, next-generation graphics, the largest battery capacity ever in a MacBook Pro, a new Magic Keyboard, and massive storage, it's the ultimate pro notebook for the ultimate user.\n\\n\n\\nRetina Display - A big, beautiful workspace. For doing big, beautiful work.\n\\nThe new MacBook Pro features a stunning 16-inch Retina display - the largest Retina display ever in a Mac notebook. It produces 500 nits of brightness for spectacular highlights and bright whites, while delivering deep blacks thanks to the precise photo alignment of liquid crystal molecules. And the P3 wide color gamut enables brilliant, true-to-life images and video. So no matter where you are, you'll see your work in the best possible light.\n\\n\n\\nThe narrow-band LED-powered backlight allows MacBook Pro to represent the P3 wide color gamut for brilliant, true-to-life color in photos and videos.\n\\n\n\\nThe oxide thin film transistor (TFT) features 10 times faster pixel charging than the traditional amorphous silicon TFT, and holds the pixel voltage steady during low-frequency power-saving modes, enabling pin-sharp resolution and longer battery life.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ P3 wide color gamut\n\\nâ¢ 500 nits of brightness\n\\n\n\\nProcessor and Memory - Working at the speed of thought.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro brings a whole new class of performance to the notebook. Thanks to a more advanced thermal design, the Intel Core processor sustains higher performance for longer periods of time - and delivers up to 2.1 times the performance of a quad-core MacBook Pro. So whether you're layering dozens of tracks and effects, rendering 3D models, or compiling and testing code, you'll be doing it in no time flat.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ 28% increased airflow\n\\nâ¢ 35% larger heat sink\n\\n\n\\nMore advanced thermal architecture enables faster processing. The thermal architecture in MacBook Pro has been completely redesigned, featuring larger impellers with improved fan blades for optimal airflow and more heat-dispersing fins for more effective cooling. The resulting gain in cooling capacity allows MacBook Pro to deliver up to 12 watts more maximum sustained power.\n\\n\n\\nLarge memory capacity means more efficient multitasking. The 16-inch MacBook Pro uses fast 2666MHz DDR4 memory for smooth performance whether you're loading hundreds of audio samples, editing billion-pixel images, or running multiple virtual machines.\n\\n\n\\nGraphics - Bending reality takes bandwidth.\n\\nThe AMD Radeon Pro 5000M series delivers the most graphics horsepower ever in a MacBook Pro. The 16-inch MacBook Pro base model is over two times faster than the previous-generation base model, for seamless playback and faster rendering of ultra-high-definition video. You'll get up to 80 percent faster performance when executing tasks like color grading in DaVinci Resolve compared with the Radeon Pro Vega 20.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ Up to 2.1x faster than Radeon Pro 560X\n\\nâ¢ 189GB/s memory bandwidth\n\\n\n\\nKeyboard - There's magic in a perfect workspace.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro takes workflow efficiency to a new level. The new Magic Keyboard features a refined scissor mechanism with 1 mm travel for a responsive, comfortable, and quiet typing experience. The Touch Bar puts powerful shortcuts front and center, and Touch ID provides fast authentication. A dedicated Escape key allows quick switching between modes and views. And the inverted-T arrow keys enable fluid navigation whether you're flying through lines of code, navigating spreadsheets, or gaming.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ Touch Bar. The commands you need most are right where you need them - saving time and keystrokes\n\\nâ¢ Touch ID. Fast, easy authentication for secure logins and purchases\n\\nâ¢ Force Touch trackpad. Speed your workflow with Force click and Multi-Touch gestures\n\\n\n\\nAudio - Bigger bass. Better mic.\n\\nMacBook Pro has a big voice. The six-speaker sound system produces room-filling wide stereo sound like you've never heard from a notebook before. Dual force-cancelling woofers dramatically reduce system vibration for a clearer, more natural sound and a half-octave lower range to the bass. And the studio-quality three-mic array rivals professional third-party microphones, for creating superclean podcasts or music recordings on the go.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ Six-speaker sound system with dual force-cancelling woofers.\n\\nâ¢ Studio-quality three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio.\n\\n\n\\nStorage - Bring your whole studio with you.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro has large amounts of SSD storage - the most available in any notebook. So you can take your photo or video libraries with you no matter where you're headed. And with superfast speeds, massive files load in an instant and pro apps launch in a blink.\n\\n\n\\nBattery - A battery with a strong work ethic.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro has the highest-capacity battery we've ever put in a notebook. The 100-Wh lithium-polymer battery not only powers the larger display and delivers higher maximum sustained power, it also provides longer battery life - up to 11 hours of wireless web browsing and video playback. So you'll have more time to work between charges - whether you're on or off the grid.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ 100-Wh battery\n\\nâ¢ Up to 11 hrs of battery life\n\\n\n\\nApple T2 Security Chip - The next generation of security.\n\\nEvery MacBook Pro is equipped with the Apple T2 Security Chip - our second-generation custom Mac silicon designed to make everything you do even more secure.

With an immersive 16-inch Retina display, superfast processors, next-generation graphics, the largest battery capacity ever in a MacBook Pro, a new Magic Keyboard, and massive storage, it's the ultimate pro notebook for the ultimate user.\n\\n\n\\nRetina Display - A big, beautiful workspace. For doing big, beautiful work.\n\\nThe new MacBook Pro features a stunning 16-inch Retina display - the largest Retina display ever in a Mac notebook. It produces 500 nits of brightness for spectacular highlights and bright whites, while delivering deep blacks thanks to the precise photo alignment of liquid crystal molecules. And the P3 wide color gamut enables brilliant, true-to-life images and video. So no matter where you are, you'll see your work in the best possible light.\n\\n\n\\nThe narrow-band LED-powered backlight allows MacBook Pro to represent the P3 wide color gamut for brilliant, true-to-life color in photos and videos.\n\\n\n\\nThe oxide thin film transistor (TFT) features 10 times faster pixel charging than the traditional amorphous silicon TFT, and holds the pixel voltage steady during low-frequency power-saving modes, enabling pin-sharp resolution and longer battery life.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ P3 wide color gamut\n\\nâ¢ 500 nits of brightness\n\\n\n\\nProcessor and Memory - Working at the speed of thought.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro brings a whole new class of performance to the notebook. Thanks to a more advanced thermal design, the Intel Core processor sustains higher performance for longer periods of time - and delivers up to 2.1 times the performance of a quad-core MacBook Pro. So whether you're layering dozens of tracks and effects, rendering 3D models, or compiling and testing code, you'll be doing it in no time flat.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ 28% increased airflow\n\\nâ¢ 35% larger heat sink\n\\n\n\\nMore advanced thermal architecture enables faster processing. The thermal architecture in MacBook Pro has been completely redesigned, featuring larger impellers with improved fan blades for optimal airflow and more heat-dispersing fins for more effective cooling. The resulting gain in cooling capacity allows MacBook Pro to deliver up to 12 watts more maximum sustained power.\n\\n\n\\nLarge memory capacity means more efficient multitasking. The 16-inch MacBook Pro uses fast 2666MHz DDR4 memory for smooth performance whether you're loading hundreds of audio samples, editing billion-pixel images, or running multiple virtual machines.\n\\n\n\\nGraphics - Bending reality takes bandwidth.\n\\nThe AMD Radeon Pro 5000M series delivers the most graphics horsepower ever in a MacBook Pro. The 16-inch MacBook Pro base model is over two times faster than the previous-generation base model, for seamless playback and faster rendering of ultra-high-definition video. You'll get up to 80 percent faster performance when executing tasks like color grading in DaVinci Resolve compared with the Radeon Pro Vega 20.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ Up to 2.1x faster than Radeon Pro 560X\n\\nâ¢ 189GB/s memory bandwidth\n\\n\n\\nKeyboard - There's magic in a perfect workspace.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro takes workflow efficiency to a new level. The new Magic Keyboard features a refined scissor mechanism with 1 mm travel for a responsive, comfortable, and quiet typing experience. The Touch Bar puts powerful shortcuts front and center, and Touch ID provides fast authentication. A dedicated Escape key allows quick switching between modes and views. And the inverted-T arrow keys enable fluid navigation whether you're flying through lines of code, navigating spreadsheets, or gaming.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ Touch Bar. The commands you need most are right where you need them - saving time and keystrokes\n\\nâ¢ Touch ID. Fast, easy authentication for secure logins and purchases\n\\nâ¢ Force Touch trackpad. Speed your workflow with Force click and Multi-Touch gestures\n\\n\n\\nAudio - Bigger bass. Better mic.\n\\nMacBook Pro has a big voice. The six-speaker sound system produces room-filling wide stereo sound like you've never heard from a notebook before. Dual force-cancelling woofers dramatically reduce system vibration for a clearer, more natural sound and a half-octave lower range to the bass. And the studio-quality three-mic array rivals professional third-party microphones, for creating superclean podcasts or music recordings on the go.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ Six-speaker sound system with dual force-cancelling woofers.\n\\nâ¢ Studio-quality three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio.\n\\n\n\\nStorage - Bring your whole studio with you.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro has large amounts of SSD storage - the most available in any notebook. So you can take your photo or video libraries with you no matter where you're headed. And with superfast speeds, massive files load in an instant and pro apps launch in a blink.\n\\n\n\\nBattery - A battery with a strong work ethic.\n\\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro has the highest-capacity battery we've ever put in a notebook. The 100-Wh lithium-polymer battery not only powers the larger display and delivers higher maximum sustained power, it also provides longer battery life - up to 11 hours of wireless web browsing and video playback. So you'll have more time to work between charges - whether you're on or off the grid.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ 100-Wh battery\n\\nâ¢ Up to 11 hrs of battery life\n\\n\n\\nApple T2 Security Chip - The next generation of security.\n\\nEvery MacBook Pro is equipped with the Apple T2 Security Chip - our second-generation custom Mac silicon designed to make everything you do even more secure. It includes a Secure Enclave coprocessor that powers Touch ID and provides the foundation for secure boot and encrypted storage capabilities. It also consolidates many discrete controllers, including the system management controller, audio controller, and SSD controller, into one.\n\\n\n\\nThunderbolt 3 - The most powerful and versatile port ever.\n\\nThunderbolt 3 combines ultra-high bandwidth with the ultra-versatility of the USB-C industry standard to create one revved-up universal port. It integrates data transfer, charging, and video output in a single connector, delivering up to 40Gb/s of throughput for twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2. MacBook Pro is equipped with four ports, so you can do all of that from either side. Existing devices are easily connected with a cable or adapter. And Thunderbolt 3 is reversible, so no matter how you plug in, it's always right side up.\n\\n\n\\nâ¢ Up to 40Gb/s data transfer\n\\nâ¢ Supports up to two 6K displays\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nApple MacBook Pro 16 Features\n\\nNinth-generation 6-core Intel Core i7 processor\n\\nStunning 16\" Retina display with True Tone technology\n\\nTouch Bar and Touch ID\n\\nAMD Radeon Pro 5300M graphics with GDDR6 memory\n\\nUltrafast SSD\n\\nIntel UHD Graphics 630\n\\nSix-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers\n\\nFour Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports\n\\nUp to 11 hours of battery life\n\\n802.11ac Wi-Fi\n\\nFull-size backlit Magic Keyboard\n\\nForce Touch trackpad\n\\nAvailable in space gray and silver\n\\nThe latest version of macOS.",

Apple launched another Macbook Pro on November 10, 2020, aside from the variant launched earlier this year. At its âOne More Thingâ event, Apple launched a range of Mac computers like the Macbook Air (M1 2020) running on its new Apple-designed processor âApple M1 chipâ that is dubbed âworldâs fastest CPU core,â in place of Intel processor and graphics options.\n\\n\n\\nThis new Apple MacBook Pro (M1 2020) comes with the same 13.3-inch Retina display with an active cooling system, 4 thunderbolt/USB, up to 16GB RAM, and up to 2TB SSD. It also comes with an advanced camera ISP and offers up to 220 hours of battery life. \n\\n\n\\nDesign \n\\n\n\\nApple MacBook Pro (M1 2020) comes with a 3-pound compact design, also known as the wedge design which is the same design as the previous model.\n\\nInstead of creating a new design, the major changes on this new laptop are basically on performance and battery life. Although, Apple makes slight changes to the display by cutting down on the display bezels.\n\\nHowever, the MacBook Pro is still crafted using aluminum material making it slim, light, sleek yet durable. It measures a dimension of 11.96 x 0.61 x 8.36 inch and weighs 3.0 pounds (1.4kg). This laptop could have been slimmer but it comes with cooling fans to give a powerful cooling solution.

It comes in gold, silver, and space gray, just like the previous MacBook Air. \n\\n\n\\nDisplay\n\\n\n\\nApple MacBook Pro (M1 2020) features the same 13.3-inch Retina display built on a LED-backlit IPS panel. The display features a 2560 x 1600 resolution resulting in 227ppi per pixel density, 500 nits brightness, P3 wide color support for vivid, and true-to-life colors.\n\\nIt also comes with a True Tone feature that matches the color temperature of the display to the ambient lighting for a more natural viewing experience thatâs easier on the eyes. \n\\n\n\\nPerformance \n\\n\n\\nThis ARM-based processor features an (eight) 8-core 5nm CPU with (four) 4 high-efficiency cores and (four) 4 high-performance cores along with an integrated GPU that has 8 cores. The M1 8-core chip has a base frequency of 3.2GHz, however, when paired with the MacBook Proâs active cooling system, it offers up to 2.8x faster than the previous generation, thus, delivering game-changing performance when compiling code, transcoding video, editing high-resolution photos, and more.\n\\nAccording to Apple, the 8-core GPU is up to 5x faster, allowing users to enjoy super-smooth graphics performance. It also comes with up to 15x faster machine learning (ML) capabilities and battery life up to 2x longer than before.\n\\nThis laptop also comes with Appleâs latest image signal processor (ISP) improves camera image quality using a 16-core Neural Engine to offer better noise reduction, greater dynamic range, and improved auto white balance and ML-enhanced face detection to offer the best picture results.\n\\nFinally, the laptop runs on macOS 11 Big Sur pre-installed to gives you more of everything you love about Mac. This latest version of the worldâs most advanced desktop operating system is packed with new enhancements for key apps including Safari, Messages, and Maps, as well as new privacy features.\n\\n\n\\nOther Features\n\\n\n\\nThis Appleâs 13-inch MacBook Pro (M1 2020) comes with studio-quality mics for super clear recordings and calls. It also supports connectivity for Appleâs Pro Display XDR in full 6K resolution. Thanks to the macOS Big Sur delivers best-in-class security coupled with Secure Enclave technology in the M1 and Touch ID.\n\\nFurthermore, Apple MacBook Pro (M1 2020) also uses the same old 720p FaceTime camera as the previous version. It also supports Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, and Touch ID.\n\\nAccording to the company, the MacBook Pro (M1 2020) delivers up to twice the battery life of the previous generation and the longest battery life ever on a Mac. It offers up to 17 hours of wireless web browsing and up to 20 hours of video playback.\n\\n\n\\nApple Macbook Pro (M1, 2020) Key Features and Specs\n\\n\n\\n13.3-inch IPS Retina display, 2560 x 1600 Pixels\n\\nTrue Tone display and Touch Bar\n\\nApple M1 chip with 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU\n\\n8 or 16 GB of unified RAM\n\\nUp to 2 TB SSD storage\n\\nScissor-switch Magic Keyboard\n\\nmacOS Big Sur\n\\nActive Cooling System\n\\n720p FaceTime HD webcam\n\\nIntegrated Fingerprint Scanner\n\\nWi-Fi 6\n\\nBluetooth 5.0\n\\nStereo Speakers + Studio Quality Mics\n\\nUp to 20 Hours Battery Life\n\\nIntegrated Touch ID sensor\n\\n16-core Neural Engine\n\\nActive Cooling System\n\\nTrue Tone display and Touch Bar \n\\nWebcam: 720p FaceTime HD Camera\n\\nUSB Ports: Yes, 4 USB 3.1 Gen 2\n\\nHDMI: Yes (via Thunderbolt with adapter)\n\\nThunderbolt Ports: Yes, 2 Thunderbolt\n\\nDisplayPort: Yes (via Thunderbolt)\n\\nVGA: Yes\n\\nEthernet (RJ-45): Yes\n\\nWLAN: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi\n\\nBluetooth: Yes, Bluetooth 5.0.",

Powered by an Apple A12 Bionic processor, the iPad Air 3 is configured with 3GB of RAM, its other remarkable features including the dual cameras, advanced connectivity features and microphones paired with a set of stereo speakers.\n\\nThe iPad Air 3 presents an upgraded design in comparison to its iPad 9.7-inch predecessor, without, however, achieving the distinctive changes made to the Pro models. By shrinking the bezels around the deviceâs edge, and that way enabling a larger screen-to-body ratio, a bigger display is offered in the new iPad. The 2019 Air model retails the Home button, unlike the 2018 Pro models, and abandons the newer Face ID in favor of the trusted Touch ID. The iPad Air 3 is also configured with the headphone port.\n\\n\n\\n.",

Replacing the A12X processor, the A12Z Bionic has performance rivaling that of laptops available today, in addition to an eight-core graphics processor that handles everything from games to 4K video editing. Moreover, it's still paired with a Neural Engine chip for advanced machine learning. \n\\n \n\\n\n\\nThe iPad Pro's display features the same Liquid Retina technology found on iPhones, and has a 2732 x 2048 resolution, ProMotion technology, wide color and True Tone support, as well as a 600 cd/m2 brightness rating. On the rear, Apple has added a 10MP ultra-wide camera, enabling different perspectives and multi-camera use. A newly added LiDAR scanner, which determines distance by determining light reflection, further readies possibilities for augmented reality and beyond. \n\\n\n\\n \n\\n\n\\nWith \"Pro\" in its name, the iPad now features five studio-quality microphones that capture clean audio and the quietest details. The combination of the pro cameras, audio enhancements, and its large display makes the iPad Pro a suitable mobile studio option for creative users. On the software side, iPadOS now supports trackpad inputs for an easier time navigating including mult-touch gestures. Lastly, Apple has opted for a USB Type-C connector rather than its traditional Lightning connector for additional features and broader compatibility with other devices.\n\\n\n\\nThis iPad comes preloaded with iPadOS. Please check your device settings for the latest available update.\n\\n\n\\nEdge-to-Edge Liquid Retina Display\n\\n\n\\nThe Liquid Retina display in the iPad Pro features wide color support, True Tone, and an anti-reflective coating for a natural, accurate viewing experience both indoors and out. It also supports ProMotion technology, which automatically adjusts the display's refresh rate, up to 120Hz, for smooth and responsive scrolling.\n\\n\n\\nA12Z Bionic Chip\n\\n\n\\nThe Apple A12Z Bionic chip, built on 7nm technology, is designed to tackle complex tasks such as editing photos, creating 3D models, and more. Additionally, a Neural Engine chip works alongside the A12Z for advanced machine learning from photography to AR.\n\\n\n\\nFace ID & Cameras\n\\n\n\\nWith the removal of the home button, the iPad Pro now utilizes its 7MP front-facing TrueDepth camera with Face ID for security and unlocking your device. It works in any position and enables you to use Apple Pay in apps as well as Animoji and Memoji in chats. At the rear is a 12MP camera, which supports 4K video, document scanning, and AR experiences, as well as a 10MP ultra-wide camera for a different perspective.\n\\n\n\\nApple Accessories\n\\n\n\\nBuilt with over 100 magnets, the iPad Pro seamlessly connects to additional accessories. The Apple pencil can magnetically attach to the side of the iPad Pro for simultaneous pairing and charging. On the other hand, the magnets firmly secure the Smart Folio Keyboard in place and detach easily for alternate viewing modes.\n\\n\n\\nUSB Type-C\n\\n\n\\nThe USB Type-C connector has replaced the Lightning connector as a one-cable solution for a wide variety of connectivity options. It supports USB 3.1 Gen 2 speeds for up to 10 Gb/s file transfers, an external 5K resolution display, and even other devices for sharing power.\n\\n\n\\nBattery Life\n\\n\n\\nBuilt with a 36.71 W lithium-polymer battery, the iPad Pro is rated to last for up to 10 hours while surfing the web on Wi-Fi, watching videos, or listening or music. Models utilizing cellular network data for these services will have around a nine hour battery life instead.\n\\n\n\\n.",

    shortDescription: 'Specification Testing & Extra Durability Features\n\\n\n\\nValidates the ruggedness, durability, and quality of ThinkPad products by testing against eight parameters: high pressure, humidity, vibration, high temperature, temperature shock, low pressure (15,000 ft), low temperature, and dust. The X130e uses thicker plastic on the bezel with integrated webcam, for extra durability. The full-sized keyboard reduces gaps between keys by 60%, so keys are less likely to be removed, and the advanced drainage system collects and diverts liquid away from circuitry through drainage hole in bottom.\n\\n\n\\nThinkVantage Active Protection System (APS)\n\\n\n\\nFor models with traditional hard drives, an accelerometer detects movement and stops the drive when a fall or similar event is detected. Rubber mounts are used for the hard disk drive (rather than rails) and the HDD connector is not rigidly attached to the board, so the connector absorbs shock and impact and protects against system damage.\n\\n\n\\nConnectivity Options\n\\n\n\\nIncludes industry-leading wireless connections for wherever, whenever access to the Web.\n\\n\n\\nPower Manager Software\n\\n\n\\nLenovos exclusive technology intuitively limits the energy drain of idle processes and provides an extra surge of energy when needed most, stretching your systems unplugged run-time to the max.\n\\n\n\\nSuperSpeed USB 3.0\n\\n\n\\nEnables up to 10 times faster file transfer, allowing for lightning-fast copying of large media files, as well as seamless connections between audio- and video-related peripherals.

The perfect choice for aspiring photographers looking for a combination of outstanding image quality and ease-of-use, the EOS 600D sits at the top of Canonâs entry-level EOS line-up, above the existing EOS 550D and the new EOS 1100D.\n\\n\n\\nCapturing stunning images and Full HD video has never been easier, thanks to a range of automatic shooting modes that beginners can use to instantly express their creativity. A Feature Guide has been added to the user interface to help you learn about the camera as you use it, helping to develop your photography skills. With an unrivalled range of EF lenses, Speedlites and other accessories to enhance your shooting, the EOS system holds the key to the perfect shot â wherever your journey takes you, and whatever the scene before you.\n\\n\n\\nFirst-class image quality\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nThe EOS 600D provides all the tools to capture beautiful stills and HD movies. Amazing picture detail is provided by a high-resolution 18 Megapixel (MP) APS-C CMOS sensor, which combines with 14-bit DIGIC 4 processing so you can capture the wonder of a beautiful blue sky and enjoy exceptionally smooth gradients between colours. The cameraâs low light shooting capability enables you to achieve clear, natural images in darker conditions, with an ISO range of 100-6400 that can be further expanded to 12800.\n\\n\n\\nGreat for shooting pets, children or wildlife, the EOS 600D allows high-speed shooting at 3.7 frames per second (fps), enabling you to capture fast-moving action. Each shot will be captured in sharp detail thanks to the 9-point Auto Focus system, which can track subjects using the auto focus points across the frame. Even more accurate focusing is providing by an extra-sensitive central AF Sensor, while the iFCL Metering system from the semi-professional EOS 7D features a 63-zone Dual-layer metering sensor, helping you to ensure your shot is correctly exposed, even in difficult lighting conditions.\n\\n\n\\nEasy shooting, amazing results\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nNew fully-automatic Scene Intelligent Auto mode makes it easy for you to capture outstanding quality shots with almost no effort. Allowing you to focus exclusively on framing your picture, Scene Intelligent Auto analyses the scene for you and automatically picks the best settings to capture it. Your images will look better than ever thanks to a new âAutoâ Picture Style, which automatically makes fine adjustments to colours while you focus on capturing the scene you want.\n\\n\n\\nThe EOS 600D also makes it easy for you to instantly add creativity to your pictures. Change the atmosphere of a scene with Basic +, which allows you to pick the mood you want to achieve from one of eight options, including âWarmâ, âCoolâ or âIntenseâ. Whether youâre shooting landscapes, portraits, or close-up macro shots, Basic + makes it easy to capture the perfect image.\n\\n\n\\nSimple, flexible, artistic\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nIdeal for beginners, a Feature Guide has been added to the EOS 600Dâs menu system, offering a brief description of each key setting and its effect, helping you learn more about the camera as you use it.\n\\n\n\\nYou can also shoot overhead, at ground level or around corners with the EOS 600Dâs Vari-angle 7.7cm (3â) 3:2 ratio ClearView LCD. Rich on-screen detail is provided in 1.04 million-dot resolution, and the side-mounted hinge allows users to comfortably and creatively shoot from a range of unusual angles, or when using a tripod. A smudge-resistant fluorine coating and three anti-reflection coatings also ensure you can see the LCD in clear detail, wherever you are.\n\\n\n\\nAllowing you to apply your own stamp to your shots, the EOS 600D is perfect for experimenting with different Creative Filters. Fish-eye-Effect creates a barrel-shaped distortion similar to a fish-eye lens, and you can instantly turn a scene into a small-scale model with Miniature Effect. Toy Camera Effect, Grainy B/W and Soft Focus offer additional options, allowing you to experiment with your images in a number of different ways.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\n\n\\nEOS 600D â key features\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nâ¢        18-megapixel CMOS sensor \n\\nâ¢        Scene Intelligent Auto mode \n\\nâ¢        Full-HD EOS Movie \n\\nâ¢        On-screen Feature Guide.',

Making high-performance full-frame imaging more accessible, the 6D Mark II makes numerous advancements over its predecessor to improve upon every aspect of image capture and creation. The main update comes in the form of a 26.2MP CMOS sensor and the use of the DIGIC 7 Image Processor to deliver sharper, more vivid imagery in a variety of shooting situations. This setup offers an improved native sensitivity range of ISO 100-40000, which can then be expanded to ISO 50-102400, as well as speedy shooting rates of up to 6.5 fps.\n\\n\n\\nEnsuring your images are tack sharp is a 45-point all cross type AF system, which is able to track subjects with accuracy. This marks a significant improvement over its predecessor and will result in faster acquisition of your subject. Along with a revamped AF system, the sensor features Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology to provide a boost to focusing in live view and video shooting, which itself has been bumped up to Full HD at 60p. This setup works well with the 3\" 1.04m-dot vari-angle touchscreen LCD, which permits use at various angles and with intuitive controls.\n\\n\n\\nFor hybrid stills/video shooters, you will enjoy the enhanced video quality as well as the ability to plug in an external mic via a 3.5mm input. Users will also have the ability to create 4K time-lapse movies as well as HDR video with dedicated settings and modes. Additionally, the body design has received an upgrade with improved ergonomics and durability, including dust and water resistance. Users will have access to many connectivity options as well, such as Wi-Fi, NFC, and Bluetooth, for connecting to a smart device, and built-in GPS for geotagging your photos.\n\\n\n\\nIncluded with the camera body is the versatile and lightweight EF 24-105mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens. This setup provides a wide-angle to telephoto zoom range that will cover most standard subject matter with ease. Also, through the implementation of an STM AF system, users will enjoy smooth, quiet focusing during stills and video shooting.\n\\n\n\\n26.2MP Full-Frame CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 7 Image Processor\n\\nOffering boosts to both resolution and low-light performance, the 6D Mark II uses a newly developed 26.2MP full-frame CMOS sensor that works in tandem with a DIGIC 7 Image Processor to create sharp, vivid imagery and video. This contributes to high performance in low light with a native sensitivity range of ISO 100-40000, which can then be expanded to ISO 50-102400 if desired.\n\\n\n\\nAssisting with the capture of properly exposed images is a 7560-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor that helps minimize the impact of flickering lights in your images and ensures accurate reading of the entire scene.\n\\n45-Point All-Cross Type AF and Dual Pixel CMOS AF Systems\n\\nEnsuring your subject is tack sharp, the 6D Mark II incorporates an all-cross type AF system, which offers 45 phase-detect points, for advanced tracking and focusing while using the optical finder for stills. This AF system can operate in lighting conditions as low as -3 EV and will work with various lenses with a maximum aperture of f/8 and smaller, though with a maximum of 27 points. Five different AF area selection modes are available as well, for optimizing performance to your subject matter.\n\\n\n\\nWhen using Live View and recording video, you can now use Dual Pixel CMOS AF on the actual imaging sensor. This offers wide coverage of phase-detection autofocus for faster and more accurate focusing in these modes. It is ideal for video as users will enjoy smoother rack focusing without the downsides normally encountered with contrast-based systems. Also, this works well with the touchscreen functions, allowing shooters to just tap to adjust focus.',

(A card error will be displayed.)\n\\n\n\\nFrom the Manufacturer\n\\n \n\\n\n\\n \n\\nIts All in the Detail\n\\n5DS R\n\\nWith all the features and capabilities of the EOS 5DS, the EOS 5DS R camera offers the potential for even greater sharpness and fine detail for specialized situations. It features the same Canon designed and manufactured 50.6 Megapixel sensor, with the low-pass filter* (LPF) effect cancelled to provide even more fine edge sharpness and detail for critical subjects such as detailed landscapes, and other situations where getting the sharpest subject detail is a priority.\n\\n\n\\n* The possibility of moirÃ© and color artifacts is greater due to the LPF cancellation function.\n\\n\n\\nThe EOS 5DS R camera has not been authorized as required by the rules of the Federal Communications Commission. This device is not, and may not be offered for sale or lease, or sold or leased, until authorization is obtained.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nSpectacular Resolution for Specialized Applications\n\\n5DS R\n\\nFor photographers wanting the ultimate in high resolution capture, the EOS 5DS R camera has a low-pass filter* (LPF) effect cancellation. While a low-pass filter is useful to reduce color artifacts and moirÃ© typical with digital capture, it also reduces detail at the pixel level. With the LPF disabled, the EOS 5DS R takes full advantage of the original resolving power of the camera's 50.6 Megapixel sensor. More detail is captured and retained in the original image, perfect for landscape and commercial applications where pixel-level detail is scrutinized and when the sharpest possible image is needed.\n\\n\n\\n*The possibility of moirÃ© and color artifacts is greater due to the LPF cancellation function.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nMore Resolution for Bigger Images\n\\n5DS R\n\\nThe EOS 5DS R camera features Canon's newest full-frame CMOS sensor. At 50.6 Megapixels, it's the highest resolution sensor in the history of EOS. It captures 8712 x 5813 effective pixels, delivering images with an unprecedented level of realism perfect for large-scale commercial printing, fine art, significant crops and any number of other high end applications. Thanks to this amazing sensor, engineered to work in concert with dual DIGIC 6 Image processors, the EOS 5DS R is a remarkable, high-resolution camera with impressive performance.\n\\n\n\\nTaking advantage of its sensor's high-resolution capturing power, the EOS 5DS R camera has a new Picture Style called Fine Detail mode. Fine Detail emphasizes fine edges and patterns or textures by setting the camera's Sharpness sub-settings, fineness and threshold to their minimum and by lowering contrast settings as well. Prioritizing minute details in the image allows for better gradations, more detailed textures and fine edges for smoother, more polished photographs.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nSpeed and Accuracy with Intelligent Scene Recognition and Analysis\n\\nThe EOS 5DS R camera has an amazing iSA Intelligent Scene Analysis system that employs an independent RGB+IR light sensor with approximately 150,000-pixel resolution. This sensor enables Canon's Intelligent Tracking and Recognition system (iTR AF) that detects and tracks subjects, automatically switching the AF point to optimize tracking. With new tracking algorithms tailored to recognize faces and colors, this system serves as a brilliant foundation to the EOS 5DS R's AF system.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nPrecise and Fast AF for High Resolution Detail\n\\n5Dsr\n\\n \n\\nFor fast, precise AF with sophisticated tracking performance, the EOS 5DS R camera has an advanced, 61-point High Density Reticular AF system with up to 41 cross-type AF points. The EOS 5DS R's AF system is incredibly sensitive to changes in composition, making adjustments quickly to help ensure consistent, sharp AF. A new RGB+IR AF (with approximately 150,000 pixels) sensor monitors subject motion, and Canon's iTR Intelligent Tracking and Recognition system synchronizes the active AF point with the subject's motion, helping to ensure that AF precision is maintained. With focus modes dedicated to the particulars of the shooting environment, the EOS 5DS R realizes a level of focus accuracy befitting its 50.6 Megapixel sensor.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nMirror Vibration Control for Sharper images\n\\n5DS R\n\\nThe camera shake that occurs from the impact of an SLR's mirror can leave blurred details in the recorded image. This effect is magnified when working with a super high-resolution sensor like the one found in the EOS 5DS R camera. To counter the effects of conventional, spring-driven SLR mirrors, the EOS 5DS R features a newly developed Mirror Vibration Control system. The camera's mirror is not controlled by springs but instead is driven by a small motor and cams. This system suppresses the impact typical of the camera's mirror, significantly reducing impact and its effects on the image. A new Time Release Lag setting, easily accessed on the EOS 5DS R's menu system offers added protection against camera-shake blur by setting the shutter release time intentionally longer so the camera does not begin the exposure until after the impact of the camera's mirror has diffused.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nBetter Accuracy in More Situations\n\\nWith Canon's Anti-flicker function, the EOS 5DS R camera is able to deliver accurate results under cycling lighting situations. Under flickering light, such as fluorescent lighting, a fast shutter speed may result in an irregular exposure. The EOS 5DS R's Anti-flicker function detects the frequency and phase of the flicker and captures images near the point of peak brightness when the subject is most likely well illuminated.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nSpecialty Controls, Built Right In\n\\nThe EOS 5DS R camera offers time-lapse fixed-point shooting and long exposures without the need for a remote control. The EOS 5DS R's interval timer takes from 1 to 99 shots at preselected intervals (from 1 second to 99 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds, or unlimited), ideal for shooting flowers as they bloom or clouds drifting through the sky. Captured exposures can even be collected and saved as an HD movie. Its built-in bulb timer keeps the shutter open for a designated amount of time, perfect for night photography, to capture the flow of traffic on a street corner, or any other situation where long exposure photography is warranted.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nSimple Cropped Shooting, In Camera\n\\nFor still photography, the EOS 5DS R camera features the flexibility of a cropping feature that extends the shooting effect 1.3x and 1.6x. With 50.6 Megapixel capture, cropped shots are possible with plenty of resolution to spare. Images recorded at 1.3x (APS-H) are approximately 30.5 Megapixels (6768 x 4512) Large/Fine JPEG, while images recorded at 1.6x (APS-C) are approximately 19.6 Megapixels (5424 x 3616) Large/Fine JPEG. Particularly useful in extending the range of telephoto lenses, the crop function also improves the EOS 5DS R's subject tracking capability with almost the entire frame covered with AF points. Image cropping can be displayed in the viewfinder either masked or overlaid with an outline showing the cropped area, and in Live View shooting the image is cropped by the effect chosen. Aspect ratios can also be defined, with the EOS 5DS R shooting in 1:1, 4:3, and 16:9 ratios, in addition to the default 3:2.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nComprehensive Information, Right in the Viewfinder\n\\nThe EOS 5DS R camera's Intelligent Viewfinder II makes it easy to both shoot, change and confirm camera settings and shooting modes all without looking away from the viewfinder. Displaying approximately 100% of the composition, the viewfinder can show settings like shooting mode, exposure level, white balance, drive mode, AF operation, metering mode, recording format, an electronic level and more. All of this information can be displayed by or superimposed easily over the image for review while shooting, and multiple views are customizable through the EOS 5DS R's simple user interface.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\nSophisticated Moviemaking with EOS\n\\nThe EOS 5DS R camera is a sophisticated movie-making machine, capturing full HD movies with numerous manual controls at multiple frame rates and compressions. Featuring movie capture and manual controls befitting a flagship camera, the EOS 5DS R's shutter button can be programmed to capture still images when pressed during movie shooting.\n\\n\n\\nALL-I\tCompresses each frame.

This high-resolution FX-format camera introduces the Z Mount, a large diameter design with a short 16mm flange distance that allows Nikon to create compact, yet powerful cameras and develop more advanced optics. The Z 7 is among the first in the series, and brings with it a 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor and EXPEED 6 Image Processing Engine, delivering outstanding image quality and speed with a native sensitivity range of ISO 64-25600.\n\\nOn the sensor you will find an advanced phase-detect autofocus system using 493 points covering 90% of the image area and the sensor features 5-axis Vibration Reduction technology for stabilized photos and video regardless of the lens used. This advanced hybrid AF system will also benefit video. The Z 7 features UHD 4K recording at up to 30p and can use the N-Log gamma profile along with the camera's 10-bit HDMI output to create cinema-quality video. The camera's high-resolution sensor also permits the use of an 8K Time-Lapse mode.\n\\nAs with many mirrorless systems, the Z Series boasts a much more compact form factor than its DSLR counterparts. The Z 7 is no exception with its slimmed down design and lighter build, though it maintains the weather sealing and ergonomics for which Nikon is known. The camera features multiple displays and screens for ease of use, including a 0.80x 3.6m-dot EVF with NIKKOR optics and a Fluorine coating, ensuring clear viewing. The rear of the camera is equipped with a 3.2\" 2.1m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD while the top offers a dot-matrix OLED for quickly checking settings. Additionally, the body is equipped with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.',

It sports a new 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor which, like the 70D, offers Canon's Dual Pixel on-sensor phase-detection autofocus system. The 80D also gains a new 45-point hybrid AF system with all of the points being cross-type. This is a step up from the 19-point AF system in the 70D, though not quite at the same level as the 65-point coverage offered by the more professionally-oriented 7D Mark II.\n\\n\n\\nCanon EOS 80D key features:\n\\n\n\\n24MP APS-C CMOS sensor with Dual Pixel AF\n\\n45-point AF system with all cross-type points\n\\n3\" 1.04M-dot articulating touchscreen\n\\n1080/60p video capture\n\\n7 fps continuous shooting with AF\n\\nWeather-resistant body\n\\n7560-pixel RGB+IR Metering Sensor\n\\nWi-Fi + NFC\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nOther improvements come in the form of a new mirror vibration control system (similar to the 5DS and 7D Mark II), which should help reduce the blur-inducing effects of shutter shock. The 80D also gains the same 7560 pixel RGB+IR metering sensor found in the Rebel T6s and T6i, a serious improvement over the 63-zone dual layer sensor found in the 70D. This new sensor gives the camera some degree of human subject awareness for subject tracking through the viewfinder. However, unlike the 7D Mark II, the 80D does not have Canon's 'Intelligent Tracking and Recognition' (iTR) system, which uses the metering sensor along with distance info to subject track.\n\\n\n\\nThe new sensor\n\\nIt's no secret that some Canon shooters have been frustrated as of late, as Sony's sensor technology marches ahead in terms of dynamic range. Fortunately, the 80D marks a significant step forward in Canon's sensor development, offering much better DR than the 70D or 7D Mark II. But the new sensor isn't interesting just because of the pictures it can capture. Dual Pixel AF not only allows for continuous focus during video capture, but during still capture (in live view mode) as well. We first saw this feature in the Rebel T6s and it is exciting to see it now making its way up Canon's food chain to enthusiast-level cameras.',

      shortDescription: "4D FOCUS\n\\n\n\\nCovering nearly the entire sensor area, a powerful 4D FOCUS system incorporates 425 on-chip phase-detection points along with 169 contrast-detection areas for precise focusing in as little as 0.05 seconds. The density of focusing points from this hybrid AF system also enables High-density Tracking AF Technology, which is adept at tracking moving subjects in a variety of lighting conditions. The use of phase-detection points also enables the use of A-mount lenses via the optional LA-EA3 or LA-EA1 lens mount adapters with full AF compatibility.\n\\n\n\\nThe apt 4D FOCUS system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject, and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighboring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. Additionally, Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized subjects' eyes for portraits and is available in both AF-S and AF-C modes. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details.\n\\n\n\\nIn addition to autofocus, the a6500 also features a Peaking MF function to benefit manual focus control by highlighted sharp edges of contrast for a more objective means of acquiring sharp focus. UHD 4K Video Recording Internal recording of UHD 4K movies is possible in multiple frame rates up to 30 fps and, based on the Super35mm recording area and effective 20MP (6000 x 3376) resolution, 2.4x oversampling renders greater detail and full pixel readout is possible, that is void of pixel binning, for higher quality imagery with reduced moirÃ© and aliasing. Full HD 1080p recording is also supported in frame rates up to 120 fps, and both resolutions utilize the 100 Mbps XAVC S format contained within an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. The high-speed, 120 fps recording also enables 4x and 5x slow-motion movie recording with the frame rate set to either 30p or 24p. In addition to high-resolution internal recording, uncompressed HDMI output also enables the use of an optional external recorder for clean 4K recording with 4:2:2 sampling.\n\\n\n\\n4K video recording also avails the ability to produce 8MP stills during playback by taking a frame grab from a movie and storing it as a separate file.   Other Camera Features\n\\n\n\\nHighlight and Average metering modes helps avoid blown-out highlights and provide stable auto exposure, respectively.\n\\nExposure standard adjustment allows you to tween exposure parameters for each metering mode independently from -1 to +1 EV in 1/6-stop increments.\n\\nA Silent Shooting mode makes use of an electronic shutter function for completely silent performance that is ideal for photographing in noise-sensitive areas.

      shortDescription: "Screen size\t2.5 inches\n\\nBattery Type\tLithium-Ion \n\\nColour\tBlack\n\\nBrand\tSony\n\\nPresenting a versatile feature-set in an especially compact design, the Sony a6100 is an APS-C-format mirrorless camera well-suited for stills and video applications. Featuring a 24.2MP CMOS sensor and a BIONZ X processor, capturing high-resolution stills with a broad sensitivity range and low noise is possible. The sensor and processor combination also affords UHD 4K video recording along with quick continuous shooting up to 11 fps for working with moving subjects. Also benefitting fast-paced shooting, Real-time Eye AF and subject tracking capabilities help to ensure sharp focus on a variety of subject types.\n\\n\n\\nComplementing the imaging capabilities, the a6100 features a 1.44m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder for clear eye-level viewing. A rear 3.0, 921.6k-dot touchscreen LCD is also available and has a 180Â° tilting design to suit working from high, low, and front-facing angles. Additionally, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enable wireless sharing of imagery as well as remote camera control from a linked mobile device.\n\\n\n\\n24.2MP Exmor CMOS Sensor\n\\nA revised APS-C-format 24.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor realizes smooth, nuanced image quality with minimal noise and high sensitivity from ISO 100-32000, which can further be expanded to ISO 51200 for working in low-light conditions. The sensor features a unique design that utilizes thin copper wiring, enhanced circuit processing, and an enhanced front-end LSI to boost light-gathering abilities, reduce noise, and increase readout speeds to benefit video recording. The sensor and BIONZ X processor combination also avails a top continuous-shooting rate of 11 fps with AF and AE and permits 14-bit raw file output for a wide tonal and color scale.\n\\nUHD 4K Video Recording in XAVC S Format\n\\nInternal recording of UHD 4K movies is possible in multiple frame rates up to 30 fps and, based on the Super35mm recording area and effective 6K resolution, oversampling renders greater detail and full pixel readout is possible, that is void of pixel binning, for higher quality imagery with reduced moirÃ© and aliasing. Full HD 1080p recording is also supported in frame rates up to 120 fps, and both resolutions utilize the 100 Mbps XAVC S format contained within an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. The high-speed, 120 fps recording also enables 4x and 5x slow-motion movie recording with the frame rate set to either 30p or 24p. In addition to high-resolution internal recording, uncompressed HDMI output also enables the use of an optional external recorder for clean 4K recording with 4:2:2 sampling.\n\\n\n\\n4K video recording also avails the ability to produce 8MP stills during playback by taking a frame grab from a movie and storing it as a separate file.\n\\n4D FOCUS\n\\nCovering nearly the entire sensor area, a powerful 4D FOCUS system incorporates 425 on-chip phase-detection points along with 425 contrast-detection areas for precise focusing in as little as 0.02 seconds. The density of focusing points from this hybrid AF system also enables High-density Tracking AF Technology, which is adept at tracking moving subjects in a variety of lighting conditions. Real-time Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized subjects' eyes for portraits (either humans or animals) and is available for both AF-S and AF-C modes. The use of phase-detection points also enables the use of A-mount lenses via the optional LA-EA3 or LA-EA1 lens mount adapters with full AF compatibility.\n\\n\n\\nThe apt 4D FOCUS system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject, and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighboring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details.\n\\n\n\\nIn addition to autofocus, the a6100 also features a Peaking MF function to benefit manual focus control by highlighted sharp edges of contrast for a more objective means of acquiring sharp focus.\n\\nBody Design and Built-In Wi-Fi\n\\nThe SVGA Tru-Finder 1.44m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder offers a bright, high-resolution means for eye-level monitoring.\n\\nA 3.0 921.6k-dot LCD touchscreen can be tilted 180Â° upward or 74Â° downward to suit working from high and low angles. The screen also incorporates White Magic technology with an RGBW pixel structure for increased brightness to support use in daylight conditions.\n\\nThe touchscreen design avails access to Touch Focus control, for immediate focus point selection, as well as a Touchpad function which lets you smoothly and intuitively select a focus point on the screen while you're looking into the viewfinder.\n\\nIntegrated 3.5mm microphone ports afford greater control over audio during video recording.\n\\nThe included NP-FW50 rechargeable lithium-ion is rated for approximately 420 shots per charge when working with the LCD screen.\n\\nIn addition to the battery, the a6100 can also be powered via a USB connection to a computer or mobile battery. This connection can also be used to charge the battery.\n\\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi enables the a6100 to instantly share imagery to mobile devices for direct sharing online to social networking, via email, and to cloud storage sites. NFC (Near Field Communication) is also supported, which allows for one-touch connection between the camera and compatible mobile devices; no complex set-up is required. Once connected, the linked mobile device can also display a live view image on its screen and remotely control the camera's shutter.\n\\nBluetooth connectivity allows for location data acquisition.\n\\n16-50mm Lens\n\\nIncluded with the camera body is the versatile E PZ 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS lens, which offers a 24-75mm equivalent focal length range. This wide to short tele zoom also incorporates power zoom control along with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization to minimize the appearance of camera shake.",

It has 4GB of memory and a 1TB Hard Disk drive. It has an Intel Celeron 1.1 to 2.6ghzGHz processor. It was with Windows 10 Home installed.\n\\nIt has 3 full-size USB ports built-in on the laptop. Video outputs include: an HDMI full-size port. It supports WiFi 802.11ac, so it's compatible with high-speed routers. It has a 0.3MP webcam for video conferencing.\n\\nThe Lenovo IdeaPad V130 measures 14.2 inches wide by 9.9 inches deep by 1 inches high, and it weighs 3.7 lbs. It's backed by a 12-month warranty\n\\nThe Lenovo Ideapad V130 breaks the mold of the contemporary 2-in-1 convertibles. Its design not only capitalizes on a more flattened and sleeker overall surface. It is ultimately a more distinctly commutable gadget to aid users to boot the system up wherever they wish to go. The Lenovo Ideapad V130 demonstrates a wide range of versatility when it comes to accomplishing essential tasks pertaining to productivity.\n\\nFirst of all, it is worth noting that the monitor of the Lenovo Ideapad V130 does not flip all the way to the rear end of the device due to the absence of a standard 360 degree angle rotation mechanism. However, it can be laid flat on a plain surface without any obstruction, which can be considered as a quirky trait, which can be put into good use.\n\\nWith immediacy, it can also be noted that the Lenovo Ideapad V130 has a 15.6 inches antiglare display, which is further magnified by thin side bezels. The visuals displayed are further accompanied with an audio system of complimentary caliber all thanks to the appreciated inclusion of Dolby Audio technology.\n\\nTherefore, the Lenovo Ideapad is generally better off to be used and focused on everyday work instead of competitive gaming. The construction of the Lenovo Ideapad is wholly made out of polycarbonate and plastic materials. This entails to the fact that the structure of the Lenovo Ideapad is prone to scratch. However, despite the materials used are of the cheaper variety, its aesthetic is surprisingly professional and pleasing to say the least. Needless to say, thoughtful development and efforts were being poured into the design of the Lenovo Ideapad without any sort of visible discrepancy.\n\\nIntel HD Graphics 610: Integrated GPU (GT1) with 12 EUs found on some low-end Kaby-Lake CPU models (15 W ULV series). Same performance as the old HD Graphics 510. Non demanding games should be playable with these graphics cards. 15-16 inch is a standard display size for laptops and offers the biggest variety of products.\n\\nLenovo: Lenovo ( Le as in the English word legend and novo (Latin) for new) was founded in 1984 as a Chinese computer trading company. From 2004, the company has been the largest laptop manufacturer in China and got the fourth largest manufacturer worldwide after the acquisition of IBM's PC division in 2005. In addition to desktops and notebooks, the company also produces monitors, projectors, servers, etc.In 2011, Lenovo acquired the majority of Medion AG, a European computer hardware manufacturer. In 2014, Lenovo took over Motorola Mobility, which gave them a boost in the smartphone marker\n\\n\n\\nBrand Lenovo\n\\nSeries Ideapad \n\\nColour iron black\n\\nItem Height 23 Millimeters\n\\nItem Width 26 Centimeters\n\\nScreen Size 15.6 Inches\n\\nMaximum Display Resolution 1366x768\n\\nItem Weight 2.2 Kg\n\\nProduct Dimensions 37.8 x 26 x 2.3 cm\n\\nBatteries: 1 Lithium Polymer batteries required.

Choose from thousands of education apps on the Chrome Web Store, including TinkerCAD, Geogebra, LucidChart, and others. And Google Play Store offers studentsâ favorite educational apps such as Khan Academy, Kahoot!, School Loop, and more. Students can easily multitask, with various windows open for apps and the browser at the same time. And the processor simultaneously supports high-definition video and demanding applicationsâall without compromising performance.\n\\n\n\\nTested classroom-tough\n\\nTeachers who say the classroom feels like a battleground, take heart â this classroom tool has military-grade durability. Built tough with rubber bumpers, reinforced ports and hinges, and a keyboard that can face whatever its users can dish out (see below), the 100e is compliant with MIL-STD-810G testing for all manner of shock and awe. Itâs also drop-resistant up to 29.5 inches (75cm) â roughly the height of a school desk.\n\\n\n\\nKeyboard withstands all hands â even the spilling kind\n\\nThe full-sized keyboard includes a sealed touchpad and resists spills of up to 1.39 cups (330 ml). And its mechanically anchored keys stay put â no excuses for not doing the latest assignment!\n\\n\n\\nCollaborate from across the room or across the world\n\\nThe front-facing 720p HD camera makes it possible to capture multimedia creative projects from anywhere, in crystal-clear definition. Whether videoconferencing or talking to a classmate on Google Hangoutsâ¢, students will be seen clearly and completely, bringing students together to make learning a collaborative process.\n\\n\n\\nHomework never looked this good\n\\nStudents will spend a lot of time looking at the 11.6-inch HD screen; its antiglare technology reduces eye strain and allows them to look at it even longer. Good news and bad news, students â you can spend more time on your homework!\n\\n\n\\nSpecifications\n\\n\n\\nProcessor : IntelÂ® CeleronÂ® N3350\n\\nOperating System : Chrome OS\n\\nDisplay : 11.6â HD (1366 x 768) antiglare display\n\\nGraphics : IntelÂ® Integrated Graphics\n\\nBattery : Up to 10 hrs with 42 Whr battery\n\\nCamera : 720p HD\n\\nMemory : 4 GB\n\\nStorage : 64 GB eMMc\n\\nPorts/Slots : 2 USB-C 2 USB 3.0\n\\nMicro-SD Audio combo\n\\nConnectivity : 802.11 AC (2x2) WiFi\n\\nBluetoothÂ®: 4.2\n\\nDimensions : (W x H x D) 29 cm x 20,4 cm x 1,99 cm (290 x 204 x 19.9 mm)\n\\nWeight : 1.25kg / 2.75lbs.',

Is the Sony A8F everything you need in a 4K TV?\n\\n\n\\nDesign\n\\nSimple designs are something Sony has been rather obsessed with for some time, and itâs one that continues in this TV.\n\\n\n\\nWe recall the days of Sonyâs âmonolithâ design, and the latest sets really feel like that idea of âjust the TVâ are still very much a part of Sonyâs aesthetic ethos.\n\\n\n\\nThat was certainly the case in last yearâs A1, though it had a massive stand to contend with, and itâs one that didnât fit all entertainment units.\n\\n\n\\nThis year, the A8F corrects that, with an OLED screen that can sit on pretty much every home entertainment unit because the stand is, well, normal.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nItâs a stand as you know it, with a flat base that connects to the Sony A8F at the back, and holds the TV up just a little, enough so that you could get cables underneath, though truth be told, thereâs not much room there.\n\\n\n\\nFor the most part, this design is focused on the screen, and what a screen it is, with a mostly bezel-free design that gets close to bleeding the picture on either side, with the smallest of frames on offer.\n\\n\n\\nThere are some very nice touches, too, such as the lack of a Sony name. Itâs there, located on the bottom right corner, but itâs the only time Sonyâs name is plastered on this thin TV, which is otherwise minimalist in every sense of the word.\n\\n\n\\nOn the reverse side, thereâs not a lot, either, with the ports amidst a plastic back, holding in much of the technology weâve seen on 2017âs A1, but in a slightly different configuration.\n\\n\n\\nFeatures\n\\nThose features are shared because the A1 proved to be such a success, so why not push them through to another TV?\n\\n\n\\nThatâs the general idea with the A8F, which doesnât technically replace its A1 sibling, but rather provides another notch in Sonyâs OLED rollout. In fact, as of early August, it now plays second to the A9F, the true follow-up to the A1, which continues the same design and upgrades the tech inside.\n\\n\n\\nAnd that essentially means you can consider the A8F like a slightly tighter version of the A1, as Sony pulls back on last yearâs model and shifts strategy.\n\\n\n\\nLast yearâs A1 already came packing with the features, and youâll find much the same here, with an LG-supplied OLED panel connecting with the features that helps make it a Sony TV. Those features include Sonyâs X-Reality Pro tech for improving the picture clarity, X1 Extreme for bringing out the High-Dynamic Range (HDR), enhancement of colours through both Triluminos and Live Colour tech, and several other bits and pieces that aim to improve colour and clarity from the original source.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nThereâs also an audio solution here, with Sonyâs Acoustic Surface technology along for the ride, using the display as a mechanism for pushing out the sound.\n\\n\n\\nUnder the hood, something needs to drive the smarts of the TV, and for that youâll find a small Android-capable computer complete with Android TV and 16GB of storage to let you install an app or two from the Google Play store.\n\\n\n\\nConnection options on the Sony A8F are well catered for, too, featuring 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, Chromecast, Composite, four HDMI including Audio Return Channel (ARC), optical, 3.5mm, and three USB ports, with the formats supporting not just the standard FAT format, but also exFAT and Windowsâ NTFS, as well.\n\\n\n\\nOh, and for folks who still want to use the Sony A8F as an actual TV, it features a DVB-T connection, too.\n\\n\n\\nDisplay\n\\nBorrowing more or less the same panel from last yearâs excellent A1 TV, the A8 gets by with the same great colour and clarity because the tech is more or less the same.\n\\n\n\\nThat means youâll be treated to an OLED panel that oozes picture quality, with a solid amount of brightness and a sharpness that just works.\n\\n\n\\nGranted, the tech on offer isnât as bright as some of the LED-backlit screens weâve seen, but the image quality is spot on what weâd expect, and pretty much packs what made the A1 excellent into a smaller design, complete with really lovely colours and clear shadows.\n\\n\n\\nYes, itâs a modern OLED display at its finest, and one that is a joy and treat to set your eyes upon.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nIn-use\n\\nWhile the display is a modern OLED screen, the remote is anything but modern, with Sony providing the same candy bar button remote that weâve seen for ages. Sure, the buttons are a little flatter and the whole thing feels a little better made than in recent years, but any of those neat flourishes you might look for â simple design or motion control â are totally absent here.\n\\n\n\\nThe downside here is that the remote can feel like the weak link, but the upside is that you donât need to relearn anything: simply grab the remote, point, and control. Itâs about as easy to use as your first TV, even if there are more menus to get through.\n\\n\n\\nAs is typical with Android TVs, there are two menus systems: one for the Android TV smart interface, and another for the TV itself.\n\\n\n\\nFor the most part, you just have to remind yourself of the differences, with the âaction menuâ on the TV letting you bypass Android and control things directly, while the home button takes you to Android for all the apps, games, and smarts a TV like this should provide.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nPerformance\n\\nPerformance of the Sony A8F is understandably quite good for watching your programs, be they in Full HD upscaled or directly in 4K Ultra HD.\n\\n\n\\nUnsurprisingly, thereâs a smooth motion technology on offer which fortunately you can turn off, though when you switch the technology completely off, you may find a little stutter from some media.\n\\n\n\\nTo fix, Sonyâs âTrue Cinemaâ mode seems to help dramatically, shifting and shaping the smooth motion so that it not only doesnât do that overly soft motion that turns everything into a cheap camera, and instead makes the movies and programs youâre watching look exactly the way theyâre supposed to.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nIn fact, we left âTrue Cinemaâ mode on pretty much the entire way for the review, and no one was the wiser. Essentially, if you leave this running, youâll find Sonyâs A8F performs in films mostly the way the director had envisioned, and without much of that whole stupidly smooth motion that infiltrates TVs regularly.\n\\n\n\\nBeyond these, the Sony A8F looks wonderful, rendering media as close to its original as one would need.\n\\n\n\\nSound\n\\nThereâs also the matter of sound, and thatâs an area where Sony has employed technology of its own design.\n\\n\n\\nWhile the panel is technically an LG screen that Sony has customised and made work with its technology, the sound department is one handled by Sony.\n\\n\n\\nThat shouldnât come as a surprise: Sony constantly reveals it has the understanding of audio to build some solid concepts, including headphones and speakers, and just like it did in the A1, it has brought one of those over.\n\\n\n\\nAlong the back, Sony has thrown in its Acoustic Surface system, a very cool audio system that uses the display to drive sound. That means thereâs a mechanism there to drive sound across the screen itself, removing the need for speakers on the front or sides and pushing the audio out.\n\\n\n\\nIn movies, it works a treat, and while it might not seem like TV speakers are generally a blessing (and usually the first thing you replace with a decent soundbar), this one actually is, and you can watch a movie comfortably with the feeling that the highs, mids, and even a bit of the lows are actually well catered for.\n\\n\n\\nItâs not going to match the oomph delivered with a dedicated subwoofer, but the impact delivered from the screen with sound pushed forward from the images youâre watching is still pretty spectacular, if we do say so ourselves.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nValue\n\\nAnd at a starting price of $3999, Sonyâs A8F feels like a marginally better deal than the A1, which started at $4599.\n\\n\n\\nTechnically (and so much as we can tell), the hardware is pretty close, but with a slightly different design and stand, and that all leads to a positive value.\n\\n\n\\nLast yearâs A1 was excellent, and while its brightness didnât quite match the likes of the Samsung LED-backlit QLED screens, it didnât need to, with the panel producing brilliant vibrancy from its OLEDs. Here, the A8F is no different, and the stand is just that much easier to get your head across.\n\\n\n\\nNo longer does it require several people to get setup and a constant concern that âoh-crap-oh-crap-itâs-going-to-dropâ soul-crushing design like the original. The A8F is the A1 with a normal stand, and a fairly solid price, for that matter.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\nMinimal impact from the branding. Itâs there in the bottom left.\n\\nWhat needs work?\n\\nBut the Sony A8F OLED 4K TV isnât all perfection.\n\\n\n\\nAs lovely as this TV is, there are a couple of things that might pick at you.\n\\n\n\\nTake the Android TV performance, which at times can feel like itâs forcing you to wait for the hardware to do its thing. Weâre not talking complicated parts of the operation either, but rather just menu controls. Some of the time, navigating either the Android TV or Bravia action menus can really feel like a slog, as if the system was doing something else and you asking to go through the menus was inconveniencing it.\n\\n\n\\nWeâre talking seconds here, people, as if a menu should take longer than a second or two to load, something we confirmed in several instances. We switched to using a different smart TV interface, leaning more on the Apple TV to control media than the Android TV interface it came with.\n\\n\n\\nNot helping this is the remote, which is positively antiquated in the grand scheme of things.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nWhile LG opts for motion, Samsung simplifies the layout, and Panasonic lets you choose between an old school remote and one with a touchpad, Sonyâs remote is just your typical candy bar remote with a whole heap of buttons. Itâs not bad, but given the remote control has been given a face lift by pretty much every major manufacturer in recent year, to see Sony still persist with an antiquated design that could be better adds to the responsiveness issues.\n\\n\n\\nIts one saving grace is the app, which on Android allows you to control the TV using your phone. We couldnât find it on iOS, highlighting another potential miss.\n\\n\n\\nFinal thoughts (TLDR)\n\\nFinding the right screen with the right colour and the right size and right design adds up to a quest for looking for all the check marks, and itâs not one made easier by a trip to your local electronic store.\n\\n\n\\nThere youâll find a surplus of screens and a deluge of displays, and you generally find you have to stand in front of the right one to have it connect with you.\n\\n\n\\nHonestly, if you were to stand in front of the Sony A8F, youâll likely connect in no time. With bright vivid colours, a simple stand, and a design that works well in any room, Sonyâs A8F is hard to beat.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nIn many ways, the Sony A8F is the cementing of what Sonyâs initial A1 tried to do, but normalised for the regular home living room, and thatâs something we like. The massive monolithic display of the previous screen was pretty, but was clearly designed for very specific rooms, and those of us with home entertainment units werenât really the focus. You needed a space for the TV, like it was its own person.\n\\n\n\\nHere in the A8F, it feels like Sony has finalised its OLED design to a point where it works in anyoneâs house, and that is a good thing, bringing with it the looks and the sound to make the picture complete.\n\\n\n\\nEven with the odd performance niggle â which we get around by using an Apple TV or a video game console as our smart environment â the Sony A8F is well worth a look for anyone interested in a best in class TV that can fit into their home comfortably. Itâs about as good as OLED gets. Highly recommended.\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nSony A8F OLED 4K TV review\n\\n\n\\nSONY A8F OLED 4K TV\n\\nDesignFeaturesPerformanceEase of useValue\n\\nTHE GOOD\n\\nFantastic colour\n\\nSuper thin\n\\nStand is fairly normal, and that's a good thing\n\\nSound system is excellent\n\\nCan be controlled via Android app\n\\nTHE NOT-SO-GOOD\n\\nAndroid TV performance can sometimes lag\n\\nRemote still isn't great\n\\nNo iOS app\n\\n4.5\n\\nShare\n\\n\n\\nLeigh :) Stark\n\\nA technology journalist working out of Sydney, Australia, Leigh has written for publications including The Australian Financial Review, GadgetGuy, Popular Science, APC, PC & Tech Authority, as well as for radio and TV since 2007.\n\\nPREV POST\n\\nSamsung times a smartwatch for October\n\\nNEXT POST \n\\nAnki connects robots with personality in Vector\n\\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE More From Author\n\\nLG ready with worldâs first 8K OLED TV\n\\nA big deal: Samsungâs Galaxy Note 9 reviewed\n\\nFoxtel gets 4K with a dedicated channel\n\\nPREV NEXT \n\\nCOMMENTS\n\\n\n\\n \n\\n\n\\nProduct Information\n\\nColour\n\\nBlack\n\\nBrand\n\\n \n\\nDisplay Features\n\\nUHD\n\\nScreen size\n\\n5.5 inches\n\\nDisplay Technology\n\\nOLED\n\\nTV Screen Size\n\\n55\n\\nWarranty Period\n\\n1 Year\n\\nTelevision 3D Technology\n\\nNo Glasses\n\\nResolution\n\\n1080p HD\n\\nIntended Display Use\n\\nHome Entertainment\n\\nTelevision Screen Type\n\\nFlat\n\\nTelevision Refresh Rate\n\\n240 Hz,',

The XEL-1 was lovely too, delivering breathtaking picture quality from a gorgeous design. There was a problem with this OLED ground-breaker, though: its screen was just 11 inches across.\n\\n\n\\nNow, a mere nine years later, Sony has finally returned to the OLED fray â and this time itâs packing something much, much bigger. Its new A1 OLED series is finally making its way to Australian shores this week in 65-inch and 55-inch sizes, giving Sony plenty of room to squeeze in 4K pixel counts.\n\\n\n\\nSony KD65A1 \n\\nAdd to this new-found abundance a unique sound system that uses the screen as the speakers and the stand as a built-in sub-woofer, as well as Sonyâs most powerful picture processing engine, and itâs easy to see why AV fans have been buzzing about the A1 range from the moment Sony first announced it at CES.\n\\n\n\\nBefore we dive too deep here, though, keep in mind that OLED is still expensive and Sony's take on the technology is no different. The 65-inch version, which is the one Sony's Australian office gave us to test, will \n\\n\n\\nDesign\n\\n\n\\nSony has been putting extra effort into the design of its products for the past couple of years, and this effort is writ large all over the 65-inch A1 OLED. It's almost impossible to come away unimpressed by this monolithic yet ultra-thin design.\n\\n\n\\nSonyâs idea with the KD-65A1 was to focus 100% on the TVâs picture, keeping the bodywork around the image to an absolute minimum. The result is a TV with nothing more than an incredibly thin black frame around all four sides of its screen. Thereâs no hint of any speakers, a stand or even a Sony logo to distract you from what youâre watching.\n\\n\n\\nDuring our time with the A1 OLED, numerous people in our office dropped by to tell us how stunning Sony's television was, with its screen about as thick as your average smartphone. No doubt about it, when it comes to design, the A1 is a real head-turner.\n\\n\n\\nOn top of this, the A1 OLED is unmatched when it comes to viewing angles, as this it experiences no loss in visual quality whatsoever when viewed completely side on.\n\\n\n\\nThe A1's unmatched viewing angles on display\n\\n\n\\nThe A1's unmatched viewing angles on display\n\\nThe screen is supported in picture frame fashion by a leg that angles out from its rear at a 3-degree angle. The television's lean is slightly noticeable when the screen is off, but once the screen was on, we were too distracted by the gorgeous images on display to notice its angle. You might notice it more if you have a particularly high cabinet.\n\\n\n\\nImpressively, the leg also has a sub-woofer built into it, bringing deep, bassy sound output and offering a nice low rumble. Meanwhile, regular sound duties are performed by the screen itself rather than normal speakers. Yes, you read that right: the screen itself delivers the sound.\n\\n\n\\n\n\\nProduct Information\n\\nColour\n\\nBlack\n\\nBrand\n\\n \n\\nDisplay Features\n\\nUHD\n\\nScreen size\n\\n6.4 inches\n\\nDisplay Technology\n\\nOLED\n\\nTV Screen Size\n\\n65\n\\nWarranty Period\n\\n1 Year\n\\nTelevision 3D Technology\n\\nNo Glasses\n\\nResolution\n\\n1080p HD\n\\nIntended Display Use\n\\nHome Entertainment\n\\nTelevision Screen Type\n\\nFlat\n\\nTelevision Refresh Rate\n\\n240 Hz.',

    shortDescription: 'The business-ready 11.6inch Latitude Mini laptop features a 1.1 to 2.9 GHz turbo boost Intel pentium N4200 processor with 8GB of memory and integrated Intel UHD Graphics to run a variety of applications from the fast 256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe solid-state drive. It also has a 360Â° hinge with four different configurations. Choose to set the computer up in laptop, stand, tent, or tablet mode to make work and collaboration comfortable and efficient. The crisp 11.6â³ touchscreen supports 1366 x 768 Mp resolution and allows clients and partners to view photos, documents, and videos from almost any angle. The display is complemented by the booming sound of the Waves Maxx Audio Pro audio system.\n\\n\n\\nTwo USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports and one USB Type-C port are available for connecting compatible peripherals such as keyboards, mice, and external storage drives with a throughput rate of up to 5 Gb/s. You can also transfer files to your computer using the built-in microSD card reader. Connect to networks wirelessly using the 802.11ac Wi-Fi or the wired Gigabit Ethernet port and host video meetings using the included webcam. The Latitude 3190 has a 3.5mm audio jack for headsets or connect wireless Bluetooth devices such as speakers, headphones, and more. Windows 10 Pro 64-bit is the installed operating system.\n\\n\n\\nThe black plastic body has rubberized bumpers around the screen and the bottom half of the clamshell, which helps protect it while being knocked around. The system is MIL-STD 801G certified to survive temperature extremes, humidity, drops from 30 inches, blowing sand and dust, and vibration. The keyboard and one-piece touchpad are spill resistant (though we don't recommend immersing the laptop in a sink or a bathtub), and the top lid is scratch-resistant. With all these protections together, this notebook should survive four years of high school or undergrad, and then some.\n\\n\n\\n \n\\n\n\\nBuilt to Last\n\\n \n\\n\n\\nThe Dell Latitude 3189 2-in-1 laptop is built to take punishment, and that's its raison d'Ãªtre. Its versatile screen caters to students working on individual and collaborative school projects, while its battery will last all day and then some. , as it has a full HD screen, and has a larger-capacity SSD, and it holds on to its Editors' Choice for midrange convertible-hybrid laptops.\n\\n\n\\nDecent Connectivity and Storage\n\\nConnectivity is sufficient for a student. There's a headset jack and a Noble security lock port on the right side. On the left, you'll find a microSD card reader, an HDMI port, and two USB 3.0 ports. Notably absent is , but that should be fine for most students and younger kids who don't have state-of-the-art peripherals. 802.11ac Wi-Fi with Bluetooth 4.2 handle wireless connections. School administrators looking to bulk-purchase the Latitude 3189 or Chromebook 3189 should note that they are designed to be stored in a Dell-branded rolling cabinet for charging and storage in the classroom.\n\\n\n\\nMemory and storage are adequate, considering the educational aim and pricing. The laptop as tested (and in its base configuration) comes with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. We prefer SSDs to hard drives because of their speedier boot and app launch times, which can come in handy during a 25-minute class.',

    shortDescription: 'Enhance your classroom with the HP 11.6 Chromebook X360 11 G3 EE Multi-Touch 2-in-1 Laptop. Designed for educators and students, this durable laptop is drop tested for up to 4', is spill resistant, and features a 1.1 GHz Intel Celeron N4020 Dual-Core processor with 4GB of LPDDR4-2400 RAM, and a dual-band 802.11ac wireless network connection to access books, tests, and more via the Google Chrome browser and G Suite applications. Integrated Intel UHD Graphics power the 11.6 1366 x 768 resolution IPS (In-Plane Switching) touchscreen, which has a 360Â° hinge for four different setup modes. They include the traditional laptop mode, a stand mode with the keyboard folded back, a flat tablet mode, and a tent mode where the computer stands on its screen edges. Use the configuration that best suits your needs.\n\\n\n\\nA 32GB eMMC solid-state drive is built into the Chromebook in addition to a microSD memory card reader for transferring files. Peripherals such as flash drives, keyboards, mice, and more can be connected to the system's USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports. Two USB Type-C ports are available for power delivery and to connect compatible external displays for more efficient multitasking or to have a larger screen for work and presenting.\n\\n\n\\nDurable Design\n\\nThis Chromebook is built with metal reinforced corners to withstand everyday wear and tear. It withstood 4' drop tests and its keyboard resists spills.\n\\nFlexible Viewing\n\\nThe 360Â° hinge allows you to configure the Chromebook to best suit your comfort and needs, whether it be the the traditional laptop mode, a stand mode, a flat tablet mode, or a tent mode.\n\\nTake It On-the-Go\n\\nWeighing just over 3 pounds, the HP X360 11 G3 EE lets you take lessons on the go with its long-lasting 47Wh battery.\n\\nStay Connected\n\\nCollaborate with others by hosting video chats using the integrated 720p webcam, built-in microphone, and stereo speakers. You can plug a wired headset into the 3.5mm connector for increased privacy or connect wireless Bluetooth headphones, speakers, and more.\n\\nUSB 3.1 Gen 1\n\\nUSB 3.1 Gen 1 features a maximum throughput of 5 Gb/s. USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.0 are synonymous.\n\\nChrome OS\n\\nUsing Linux as a base, Google designed Chrome OS to work exclusively with web applications. The user interface takes a minimalist approach, which greatly resembles the Google Chrome web browser. Chrome OS was built for people who spend a majority, if not all, of their time on the computer connected to the internet. The only application that comes installed on Chrome OS is a special Google Chrome web browser with an integrated media player and file manager. All other applications are accessed by adding apps from the Google Chrome Web Store. Since Chrome OS relies entirely on Google's web apps and access to Google's services, it is highly recommended that you connect to the internet to optimize your Chrome OS experience.',
